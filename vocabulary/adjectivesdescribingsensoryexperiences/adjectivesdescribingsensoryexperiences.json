Non-stick cookware is valued for its ease of use and cleaning, as it allows food to slide off the surface with minimal effort and prevents the need for excessive oil or butter. It is commonly used for frying pans, saucepans, and bakeware, however, it is important to follow manufacturer instructions and avoid using metal utensils or high heat with non-stick cookware to prevent damage to the
