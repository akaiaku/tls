It consists of three main parts: the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. The outer ear includes the visible part called the auricle or pinna and the ear canal, which leads to the eardrum. The middle ear contains the eardrum and three tiny bones called the ossicles, which transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear. The inner ear houses the cochlea, a spiral-shaped structure responsible for converting sound into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. In addition to hearing, the ear also plays a crucial role in our sense of balance and spatial orientation."},{"word":"perspective","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cGVyc3BlY3RpdmU&hash=5a86ddba161e579ae0b16bd34489b04093414f87&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"pɝˈspɛktɪv","translation":"a specific manner of considering something","description":""},{"word":"partner","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cGFydG5lcg&hash=91fa5824e9ab9010a205fb18c2f43127a451df91&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/28159/original/spouse?type=jpeg","phonetic":"ˈpɑɹtnɝ","translation":"the person that you are married to or having a romantic relationship with","description":""},{"word":"cup","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Y3Vw&hash=6c7182884a298c6f4cab787624857c4d86e4479e&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/27105/original/cup?type=jpeg","phonetic":"kʌp","translation":"a small bowl-shaped container, usually with a handle, that we use for drinking tea, coffee, etc.","description":""},{"word":"belief","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YmVsaWVm&hash=86cdd5b220cdfdce85987b8184ad8e895596eed0&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/52113/original/trust?type=jpeg","phonetic":"bɪˈɫif","translation":"a strong feeling of certainty that something or someone exists or is true a strong feeling that something or someone is right or good","description":""},{"word":"break","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YnJlYWs&hash=d95de3db3ce6955e70bb482a4e1c418429d97bff&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/16419/original/break?type=jpeg","phonetic":"ˈbɹeɪk","translation":"a rest from the work or activity we usually do","description":""},{"word":"mission","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=bWlzc2lvbg&hash=f3622ced0d97a338de1387c17594d4da3f837c67&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈmɪʃən","translation":"an important task that people are assigned to do, particularly one that involves travel abroad","description":""},{"word":"subject","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=c3ViamVjdA&hash=84940577ecf6ded51b9ed839e05aea89d5fb9257&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈsəbdʒɪkt/, /səbˈdʒɛkt","translation":"someone or something that is being described, discussed, or dealt with","description":""},{"word":"technique","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=dGVjaG5pcXVl&hash=6f1be6f4feb916906035eb74a4c7e70b030fd676&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"tɛkˈnik","translation":"a specific method of carrying out an activity that requires special skills","description":""},{"word":"client","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Y2xpZW50&hash=686a32eb6299dd64e8a1f7febc100b501f034a68&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/26238/original/?type=jpeg","phonetic":"ˈkɫaɪənt","translation":"a person or organization that pays for the services of a company or recommendations of a professional","description":""},{"word":"boss","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Ym9zcw&hash=cc8832986e00d3287a2cfc1e34c80af76d04b8e5&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"https://cdn.langeek.co/photo/40741/original/boss?type=jpeg","phonetic":"ˈbɑs/, /ˈbɔs","translation":"a person who is in charge of a large organization or has an important position there","description":""}]}]
