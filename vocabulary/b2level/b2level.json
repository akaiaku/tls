Suffixes can change the part of speech, tense, or number of a word. For example, adding the suffix \"-ing\" to the verb \"run\" forms \"running,\", indicating an ongoing action. Similarly, adding the suffix \"-ful\" to the noun \"beauty\" creates the adjective \"beautiful\", which describes something that has beauty. Suffixes play an important role in word formation and help expand vocabulary in many languages."},{"word":"active","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YWN0aXZl&hash=0f3f4e1e27b778ea3843637855738d56a98127ef&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈæktɪv","translation":"(grammar) describing a verb whose subject is the one that does the action","description":""},{"word":"passive","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cGFzc2l2ZQ&hash=e56d7d704ff2ce361aedd9bf812fa78dbedb7e90&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈpæsɪv","translation":"(grammar) describing a verb whose subject is affected by the action of the verb","description":""},{"word":"comparative","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Y29tcGFyYXRpdmU&hash=7bd1122191b6961631a38a49bce2743dd087ea86&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"kəmˈpɛɹətɪv","translation":"(grammar) describing adverbs or adjectives that indicate a difference in degree, quality, size, etc.","description":""},{"word":"superlative","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=c3VwZXJsYXRpdmU&hash=23828c6ea06aab46b46d7f308358c06c3370bc1d&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"sʊˈpɝɫətɪv","translation":"(grammar) describing the highest amount or degree of an adjective or adverb","description":""},{"word":"plural","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cGx1cmFs&hash=7207676043cd3c6c94c728acd7cae4866e1cde0f&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈpɫʊɹəɫ","translation":"(grammar) describing words that are indicating the presence of more than one person or thing","description":""},{"word":"singular","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=c2luZ3VsYXI&hash=d118afb776091a3e44423ea31903db4bd28c717c&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈsɪŋɡjəɫɝ","translation":"(grammar) describing words that are indicating the presence of only one person or thing","description":""},{"word":"grammatical","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Z3JhbW1hdGljYWw&hash=98c83f62418b05084f00d77766bd46e0a91d8d96&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ɡɹəˈmætəkəɫ/, /ɡɹəˈmætɪkəɫ","translation":"following the standard rules of the grammar properly","description":""},{"word":"irregular","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=aXJyZWd1bGFy&hash=1c52504db8966267c18abf67dddaaac10ba7f446&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˌɪˈɹɛɡjəɫɝ","translation":"(of verbs, nouns, or adjectives) not following standard patterns or rules","description":""},{"word":"modal","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=bW9kYWw&hash=56b405f23ebd27f703578dc89d83d8955e558d00&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈmoʊdəɫ","translation":"(grammar) a verb that is used with the main verb of a sentence to indicate possibility, intention, etc., such as can, might, should, etc.","description":"A modal is a type of auxiliary verb used to express necessity, possibility, permission, or ability.
