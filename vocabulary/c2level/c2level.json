In languages with vowel harmony, vowels that are similar in these features tend to occur together, while vowels that differ may be restricted from appearing in the same word. For example, in Turkish, if a word begins with a front vowel, the subsequent vowels in the word will also typically be front vowels, as in \"kedi\" (cat), while a back vowel would lead to a different pattern. Vowel harmony is important in linguistics because it helps to organize vowel usage within languages and contributes to understanding phonological rules and sound patterns."},{"word":"hyponym","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=aHlwb255bQ&hash=84109516baa32280ffb2bdb069aa2201d716ba07&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"hˌaɪpoʊnˈɪm","translation":"a word that represents a subset of a broader category","description":""},{"word":"synchronic","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=c3luY2hyb25pYw&hash=b26b5f410ef9809b82ff449f535d8aae8c28aa10&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"sɪŋˈkɹɑnɪk","translation":"related to the study of a phenomena at a specific point in time, particularly in linguistics and social sciences, without considering historical changes","description":""},{"word":"diachronic","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=ZGlhY2hyb25pYw&hash=5ec8abd76d6e2b581d80e15041fd7da0e9946076&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"dˌaɪəkɹˈɑːnɪk","translation":"related to the study or analysis of phenomena or changes over time, particularly within linguistics or historical contexts","description":""}]},{"title":"Politics","data":[{"word":"utopia","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=dXRvcGlh&hash=d7d2604ef2fe4434b9e01bd3645262f59758babe&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"juˈtoʊpiə","translation":"an imaginary state or location where everything is perfect","description":""},{"word":"absolutism","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YWJzb2x1dGlzbQ&hash=b1a95aeb7e95bcf463972858ffa3d82519dbcb83&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈæbsəˌɫuˌtɪzəm","translation":"the belief in a political theory that stands for giving the total power to a single person or government at all times","description":""},{"word":"populism","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cG9wdWxpc20&hash=0d0fc57eb3e2fcc5469c4b945ede590eb9605248&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈpɑpjəˌɫɪzəm","translation":"a type of politics that purports to represent the opinions and desires of ordinary people in order to gain their support","description":""},{"word":"totalitarianism","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=dG90YWxpdGFyaWFuaXNt&hash=ab51ad2fedd208bad82c98bd4cd0336750e021a6&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˌtoʊˌtæɫəˈtɛɹiəˌnɪzəm","translation":"the belief in and implementation of a political system where the government possesses absolute control over its citizens","description":""},{"word":"psephology","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=cHNlcGhvbG9neQ&hash=ab577662eab8203b621b4008ad83425d6cb96c61&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"sɛfˈɑːlədʒi","translation":"the scientific study of elections, including the analysis of voting patterns, behavior, and electoral systems, to understand and predict political outcomes","description":""},{"word":"agitprop","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YWdpdHByb3A&hash=12210a7fbc9beb4517e86868792bcdbc4599f938&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈædʒətˌpɹɔp","translation":"the political propaganda, especially in the form of art, literature, or media, used to promote a particular ideology, cause, or political agenda","description":""},{"word":"brinkmanship","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=YnJpbmttYW5zaGlw&hash=4e1accf45a6083430598d9f81f496179fcad215b&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"ˈbɹɪŋkmənˌʃɪp","translation":"the practice of pushing a dangerous situation or confrontation to the edge of disaster, often with the intention of achieving a specific outcome","description":""},{"word":"constitutionalism","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=Y29uc3RpdHV0aW9uYWxpc20&hash=b4d5f07fe3d1018c946348b86f0c30d218ebcdb9&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"kˈɑːnstɪtˌuːʃənəlˌɪzəm","translation":"the commitment to governing in accordance with the principles and provisions specified in a constitution, promoting the rule of law and safeguarding individual rights","description":""},{"word":"dog whistle","audio":"https://tts.langeek.co/read?text=ZG9nIHdoaXN0bGU&hash=a1feb04baddb807c2bb6ed088707649ff969f1ee&lang=en&cache-only=0","image":"","phonetic":"dˈɑːɡ wˈɪsəl","translation":"a coded message intended to be understood by a particular group while remaining unnoticed or ambiguous to others","description":"The term \"dog whistle\" originally referred to a whistle used in dog training, emitting a sound only audible to dogs.
